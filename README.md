# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

As a post web developer or coding staff, it is very important to be aware of the significance of keeping sensitive or private data confidencial. So that creating a strong password generator along with certain criterias is critical to access and store sensitive data. For companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data, weak passwords can pose a real security threat. An application that can generate strong passwords quickly and effortlessly saves employees time and ensures secure access to data. 

Currently, the password generator I built has a few criterias as below:
* Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)
* Character type (Must meet at least one of below type):
  * Special characters
  * Numeric characters
  * Lowercase characters
  * Uppercase characters

In the process of building this password generator, I have learned:
* Utilize Github repository, familiarize git commands to save all my works onto github
* Familiarize the basic html commands to build the full contents of the site, especially have better understanding on div.
* Familiarize the styling commands on css, especially have better understanding on float, padding, margin, position
* Familiarize the bootstrap tags and utilize the documentations resourses on bootstrap website
* Realize using Bootstrap tags to build the main structure of the site is much more consice and easier
* Familiarize using javascript to add more functional features along with html and css styling
* Especially heavily using "alert", "prompt", "confirm", "function()", "onclick" and etc.
